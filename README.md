### **Discover-Focus-Act (DFA) Framework**

### **Overview**  
The **Discover-Focus-Act (DFA) Framework** is a simple, effective tool for problem-solving and creating actionable plans. It guides individuals, teams, or workshops through three clear stages: Discover, Focus, and Act, ensuring **clarity**, **focus**, and **measurable results**. Ideal for sessions of 60 minutes or divided into shorter segments, DFA drives progress efficiently.

---

### **Why Choose DFA?**  
- Easy to use, no extensive training required.  
- Structured steps with prompts for actionable inquiry.  
- Bridges the gap between problem analysis and concrete actions.  
- Encourages clarity, measurable outcomes, and practical results.  
- Promotes collaboration, alignment, and accountability.

---

### **When to Use DFA**  
- Solving complex problems.  
- Aligning teams on priorities.  
- Developing actionable plans for immediate results.  
- Suitable for both personal and professional contexts.

---

### **Icebreaker Activity (5 Minutes - Optional)**  
**Purpose**: Energise participants and clarify the problem.  
**Instructions**:  
- Ask: *“If this problem were a headline in tomorrow’s newspaper, what would it say?”*  
- Participants share their headlines (funny, serious, or creative).  
- Agree on a headline that best captures the essence of the problem.  

**Note**: This activity is entirely optional and can be skipped if you're short on time or prefer a more focused start to the session.  

**Time-saving Alternative**: If pressed for time, participants can silently brainstorm and write down a problem statement.

**Output**: Problem Statement  

**Transition**:  
*“Now that we have our collective Problem Statement, let’s dive into understanding it better and defining what success looks like.”*

---

### **Steps**

#### **1. Discover (20 Minutes)**  
**Input**: Problem Statement  
**Purpose**: Gain a clear understanding of the problem and desired outcomes.  

**Instructions**:  
- Explore the issue from different perspectives to clarify the situation and desired outcomes. Break the problem into manageable components.  
- Use prompts to guide the discussion and ensure a thorough understanding.  

**Prompts**:  
- *"What’s the issue?"* Describe the current state of the problem.  
- *"What do we want to achieve?"* Define the desired outcome.  

**Tool**: Complete the "Discover" step in the DFA Template.  
**Output**: Current Situation  

**Transition**:  
*“With a clearer understanding of the problem, let’s focus on identifying key priorities to address first.”*

---

#### **2. Focus (20 Minutes)**  
**Input**: Current Situation  
**Purpose**: Identify and prioritise the most critical actions.  

**Instructions**:  
- Review the insights from Discover to pinpoint the highest-priority areas for immediate action.  
- Use dot voting or discussion to focus on the most impactful elements.  

**Prompts**:  
- *"What’s most important to address first?"* Prioritise the most critical components.  
- *"What can we realistically achieve now?"* Focus on actions that are feasible in the short term.  
- *"What’s the impact of addressing this now?"* Assess the immediate benefit of tackling this priority.  

**Tool**: Use the "Focus" step in the DFA Template.  
**Output**: Key Priority  

**Transition**:  
*“Now that we’ve identified our top priority, let’s develop a concrete action plan.”*

---

#### **3. Act (20 Minutes)**  
**Input**: Key Priority  
**Purpose**: Create a clear, actionable plan.  

**Instructions**:  
- Convert the identified priority into a concrete action plan. Assign roles, define immediate actions, and ensure steps are achievable.  
- Ensure clear ownership for each task.  

**Prompts**:  
- *"What one step can we take immediately?"* Identify the first step that can be taken without delay.  
- *"What resources or support do we need?"* Define the necessary tools, people, or resources.  
- *"How will we measure progress?"* Establish measurable success criteria with clear metrics.  
- *"What will success look like?"* Define tangible outcomes that signal progress or completion, ensuring alignment with the core objectives.  

**Tool**: Complete the "Act" step in the DFA Template.  
**Output**: Action Plan  

**Transition**:  
*“With our action plan in place, it’s time to implement. Afterward, we’ll gather feedback to refine our approach.”*

---

### **Next Steps**  
Once the action plan is in progress, revisit the DFA Framework regularly to refine priorities and make adjustments as needed. This iterative process ensures ongoing improvement.

**Transition to Feedback**:  
*“Once the plan is implemented, we’ll reflect on the results, celebrate successes, and adjust where needed.”*

---

### **Gathering Feedback**  
**Purpose**: Reflect on outcomes and refine the approach.  

**Instructions**:  
- Encourage open feedback to assess what worked, what didn’t, and areas for improvement. Use this input to adjust the plan.  

**Prompts**:  
- *"What worked well?"* Identify successes.  
- *"What didn’t work?"* Assess challenges and areas for improvement.  
- *"What can we do differently next time to improve the process?"* Gather insights on potential improvements for future sessions.  
- *"How can we refine the plan?"* Adjust based on feedback and insights.  

**Closing Reflection**:  
*“Feedback helps us continue improving and ensures we stay on track with our goals.”*

---

### **Features**  
- **Duration**: 60 minutes (20 minutes per step).  
- **Audience**: Suitable for individuals, teams, or workshops.  
- **Output**: A focused, actionable plan for immediate implementation.

### **For Experienced Facilitators: Customising the DFA Framework**

The DFA Framework is designed to be adaptable, allowing experienced facilitators to adjust the process to suit their specific needs. Below are some tips for customising the framework:

#### **Customising Prompts**  
Experienced facilitators may have their own preferred prompts or techniques. Feel free to replace the suggested questions with those that best align with the group’s goals and dynamics. For example, instead of asking *“What’s the issue?”*, you might ask more detailed questions like *“What root causes are contributing to this issue?”* or *“What assumptions are we making?”*.

#### **Adjusting Time Slots**  
While the DFA Framework is designed for a 60-minute session, you can adjust the time allocations as needed. For instance:
- **If you have more time**: Consider expanding each step to allow for deeper discussions or additional activities (e.g., group brainstorming, role-playing, or ideation).
- **If you have less time**: Condense the steps by focusing on the most critical questions and streamlining the decision-making process. 

#### **Advanced Facilitation Techniques**  
- **Dot Voting & Prioritisation**: If your group is large, consider using online tools for voting or prioritisation, such as Mentimeter or Miro, to ensure everyone’s input is captured and visible.
- **Breakout Groups**: For larger teams or workshops, split the group into smaller breakout groups during the **Discover** or **Focus** stages. This can help generate more diverse insights and allow for more personalised discussions.
- **Time Management**: Experienced facilitators may want to set stricter time limits for each step, particularly in larger sessions, to ensure focus and avoid long-winded discussions. Use a timer to keep track and signal transitions clearly.

#### **Flexibility in Transitions**  
The transitions between steps are designed to be smooth, but you can adjust them based on your own style and the group’s needs. For example:
- Instead of directly transitioning to the **Focus** step, you might choose to conduct a brief recap of the **Discover** stage before moving forward.
- If your group needs more time to reach consensus or clarity, feel free to extend certain sections of the framework and adjust subsequent steps accordingly.
