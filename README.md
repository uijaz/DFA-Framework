### **Discover-Focus-Act (DFA) Framework**

### **Overview**
The **Discover-Focus-Act (DFA) Framework** is a practical tool for solving problems and creating actionable plans. Offering clear steps, flexibility, and impactful outcomes, it guides individuals, teams, or workshops through three key stages: Discover, Focus, and Act. This framework ensures **clarity**, **focus**, and **measurable results**. Ideal for sessions lasting 60 minutes or broken into smaller segments, DFA helps drive progress efficiently.

---

### **When to Use the DFA Framework**
- Tackling complex problems.
- Aligning teams on priorities.
- Developing action plans for immediate implementation.
- Suitable for both personal and professional contexts.

---

### **Icebreaker Activity (5 Minutes - optional if problem is not yet understood)**
**Purpose**: Energise participants and create a collaborative atmosphere to understand the problem.  
**Instructions**:  
- Ask: *“If this problem were a headline in tomorrow’s newspaper, what would it say?”*  
- Let everyone share their headlines (funny, serious, or creative). This helps engage participants and sets a collaborative tone.  
- Once all participants have shared, encourage everyone to agree on a headline that best captures the essence of the problem. This reinforces alignment on the issue and helps participants focus on the problem statement.  

**Time-saving Alternative to Icebreaker**: If short on time, participants can silently brainstorm and write down a problem statement.

**Output**: Problem Statement  

**Transition to Discover**:  
*“Now that we’ve identified our collective Problem Statement, let’s dive deeper to fully understand the problem and define what success looks like.”*

---

### **Steps**

#### **1. Discover (20 Minutes)**  
**Input**: Problem Statement  
**Purpose**: Understand the problem and clarify desired outcomes.  

**Instructions**:  
- Explore the issue from multiple perspectives to clarify the current situation and desired outcomes. Begin by defining the overarching problem, then deconstruct it into manageable components.  
- Use the prompts to guide conversations and ensure a comprehensive understanding of the problem and what success looks like.  

**Prompts**:  
- *What’s the issue?* Describe the current state of the problem.  
- *What do we want to achieve?* Define the desired outcome.  

**Tool**: Complete the "Discover" step in the DFA Template.  
**Output**: Current Situation  

**Transition to Focus**:  
*“With a clearer understanding of the problem and what we hope to achieve, let’s determine which areas to prioritise and tackle first.”*

---

#### **2. Focus (20 Minutes)**  
**Input**: Current Situation  
**Purpose**: Identify and prioritise critical action areas.  

**Instructions**:  
- Review the insights from the Discover step and determine the most critical areas for immediate action. Focus on elements that can deliver maximum impact within a short timeframe.  
- Use dot voting to identify critical areas for action.
- Use the prompts to facilitate prioritisation and keep the focus on achievable, high-impact areas.  

**Prompts**:  
- *What’s most important to address first?* Prioritise the most critical components.  
- *What can we realistically achieve now?* Focus on actions that are feasible in the short term.  
- *What’s the impact of addressing this now?* Assess the immediate benefit of tackling this priority.  

**Tool**: Use the "Focus" step in the DFA Template to narrow down focus.  
**Output**: Key Priority  

**Transition to Act**:  
*“Now that we’ve identified our top priority, let’s translate it into a clear and actionable plan to begin making progress right away.”*

---

#### **3. Act (20 Minutes)**  
**Input**: Key Priority  
**Purpose**: Develop a clear, actionable plan.  

**Instructions**:  
- Transform your prioritised insights into a concrete plan. Discuss what can be done immediately, assign roles, and ensure the steps are practical and achievable.  
- Assign clear ownership for each action step to avoid ambiguity.
- Use the prompts to guide discussions and craft a detailed, actionable plan that participants can confidently implement.  

**Prompts**:  
- *What one step can we take immediately?* Identify the first step that can be taken without delay.  
- *What resources or support do we need?* Define the necessary tools, people, or resources.  
- *How will we measure progress?* Establish measurable success criteria with clear metrics.  
- *What will success look like?* Define tangible outcomes that signal progress or completion, ensuring alignment with the core objectives.  

**Tool**: Complete the "Act" step in the DFA Template.  
**Output**: Action Plan  

**Transition to Feedback**:  
*“With our plan ready, it’s time to put it into action. Once implemented, we’ll gather feedback to evaluate its effectiveness and refine where necessary.”*

---

### **Next Steps**  
Once the action plan is underway, revisit the DFA Framework regularly to refine priorities or adjust the course as needed. This iterative approach ensures continued progress and improvement.

**Transition to Gathering Feedback**:  
*“After implementing the plan, we’ll reflect on the results to celebrate successes, identify improvements, and continue building on what we’ve accomplished.”*

---

### **Gathering Feedback**  
**Purpose**: Reflect on outcomes after implementing the action plan.  

**Instructions**:  
- Encourage open and honest feedback to identify what worked, what didn’t, and what could be improved. Use this input to refine future plans and adapt as necessary.  

**Prompts**:  
- *What worked well?* Identify successes.  
- *What didn’t work?* Assess challenges and areas for improvement.  
- *How can we refine the plan?* Adjust based on feedback and insights.  

**Closing Reflection**:  
*“Feedback is key to progress. By reflecting on today’s outcomes, we can continue to refine our approach and ensure we’re moving in the right direction.”*

---

### **Features**
- **Duration**: 60 minutes (20 minutes per step).  
- **Audience**: Suitable for individuals, teams, or workshops.  
- **Output**: A focused, actionable plan ready for immediate implementation.
